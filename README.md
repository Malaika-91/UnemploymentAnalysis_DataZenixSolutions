# UnemploymentAnalysis_DataZenixSolutions
📊 Unemployment Analysis During COVID-19
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Unemployment trends before, during, and after COVID-19 using Python. The dataset includes Unemployment Rate (%), GDP Growth Rate (%), and other economic indicators across different years. By categorizing time into three phases (Before, During, and After COVID-19), we explore how the pandemic affected global employment and economic growth.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas → Data handling & cleaning

Matplotlib → Data visualization

Seaborn → Advanced plotting & styling

📂 Dataset

File: Unemployement.csv

Columns include (example):

Year

Unemployment Rate (%)

GDP Growth Rate (%)

(Other economic indicators)

🔑 Key Features

Data Exploration (EDA):

Dataset info, missing values, duplicates, summary statistics.

Categorization:

Divides timeline into:

Before COVID-19 (Years < 2020)

During COVID-19 (2020–2021)

After COVID-19 (Years > 2021)

Statistical Comparison:

Calculates average indicators for each time phase.

Data Visualization:

📈 Line Plot: Unemployment rate vs. Time

📊 Bar Plot: Unemployment vs. GDP Growth

📉 Comparison Bar Chart: Average indicators across phases

📦 Boxplot: Unemployment distribution by time

🔥 Heatmap: Correlation between economic indicators

📊 Sample Insights

Unemployment rates spiked during COVID-19.

GDP growth rate showed negative correlation with unemployment.

Post-COVID recovery shows improving trends but varies across indicators.
