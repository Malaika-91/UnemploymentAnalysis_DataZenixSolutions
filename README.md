# UnemploymentAnalysis_DataZenixSolutions
# 📊 Unemployment Analysis Project

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on **Unemployment Trends and Economic Indicators** across different time periods — before, during, and after COVID-19. The project leverages **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.

## 🚀 Features

* Import, clean, and explore unemployment datasets
* Handle missing and duplicate values
* Categorize data into **Before COVID-19**, **During COVID-19**, and **After COVID-19**
* Perform statistical summaries and group-wise comparisons
* Generate insightful visualizations:

  * Line plots showing unemployment rate over time
  * Bar plots comparing unemployment and GDP growth rate
  * Boxplots to analyze unemployment distribution across periods
  * Heatmaps for correlation analysis
* Structured codebase with scripts and optional Jupyter notebook
